IMPLEMENTED IMPORTANT FEATURES

ORDER_BOOK FEATURES

The initial two charts show-case bids and asks (14 values) in real time.

The user can leave the webpage open and comeback to see the fluctuations in bids and asks volumes relative to the last time.

The relaive gain/loss in volume is indicated by green and red respectively.

With a click on the chart (bids or asks), the app registers the then existing volume, and further updates in the volumes are shown relative to the volumes when user clicked.

This allows the user to easily keep a track of the rise/fall in volume compared to the last time he checked the charts as opposed to the last time the volume got updated.

TRADES_FEATURES

The subsequent graph at the bottom showcases the transactions which occurred within the past 24 hours. The chart gets updated in real time.

The happening of a new transaction is an important event, and the user is informed about the same via a sliding window which carries details of the last/most recent transaction, which also gets updated on the graph.

With a click on the slided window, the user can dismiss it.

In case of multiple new transactions occurring while a user is not paying attention, the sliding window will always convey details about the latest transaction only.
